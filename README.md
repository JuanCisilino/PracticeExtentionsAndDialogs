# PracticeExtentionsAndDialogs

On this exercise the user will have a button that opens up a dialog asking if he prefers a short Toast or a long one.

The idea is to show through the code the performance of  the extensions, in this case the Toast method is placed as an extension of Activity.

The dialog is customized to show the options in order to simplify and clean the code.
